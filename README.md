# `pb`: Write once, publish anywhere

`pb` is a command-line tool designed to facilitate a multi-platform, scientific
publishing workflow.

It allows you to write your posts locally using scientific-styled Markdown
(tables, code blocks, footnotes, and math formulas) *and* publish to external
hosts[^1] while maintaining the structure of the original post.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/jdkato/pb
