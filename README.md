# `pb`: Write once, publish anywhere

`pb` is a command-line tool designed to facilitate a multi-platform, scientific
publishing workflow.

It allows you to write your posts locally using scientific-styled Markdown (
tables, code blocks, footnotes, and math formulas) *and* publish to external
host[^1] while maintaining the structure of the original post.


[^1]: Currently, only [Medium](https://medium.com/) is supported.
